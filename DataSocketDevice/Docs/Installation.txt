Each Datasocket device can read up to 32 variables.
The VariableCount parameter has to be set to the no of variables the device should read (max 32)
The datatype of the parameter can be either boolean or double. 

For double datatype, Device currently expects an array of string which is converted to double. Devices/datasocket connections which send double array will not work.

For Boolean datatype, T/F is converted to 1/0 and saved in the database.
