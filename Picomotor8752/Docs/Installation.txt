the device has to be connected to a computer serial port using a null modem serial cable. it can also be connected to an ethernet switch. The Db editor has a mode variable that has to be switched for serial/tcp communication. provide the static ip for tcp or the COM port no for serial.
The tcp communication is very slow as compared to the serial. cause unknown. Even test VIs from the company behave the same.

Static ip address assignment is done using hyperterminal over serial connection. commands are in manual. baud rate 19200.
