This devcie uses a NI daq pad. Users need to create a DI task and enter the task name as a variable in the db for this devicetype. 
triggerbeforepulse variable is the time between the trigger pulse input to the daq task and the arrival of the actual laser pulse.
The hamamatsu always runs in asynchronous mode with internal software triggers. It will acquire a minimum of 3 acquisitions if the exposure time is equal to or greater than the triggerbeforepulse time.
example: triggerbeforepulse = 10 ms, exposure = 5 ms , No of acquisitions = (triggerbeforepulse/exposure)+3 = 5 acquisitions.
Try to keep the exposure nearly equal but slightly smaller than triggerbeforepulse. It will ensure the capture of the spectral signal.
