The Alicat pressure Controller devices type is a much simpler device than the AlicatPC. 

The variable, ATMReaderEnabled has to be ON if the Atmospheric reader is available on the system and the pressure controller is a PSIG controller.

When the ATMreaderEnabled variable is OFF, it should be assumed that the measurement units are in the native units of the controller being used.

There is another variable called WaitForSteadyStateEnable. This variable turns on an algorithm that waits for the pressure to reach steadystate before sending a slow response to Master Control.

All readings are in PSIA for PLASMA 1 as of April 25th 2013
PLASMA 2 cannot be used
