GUI_HamamatsuSpectrometer is the general GUi for all spectrometers. It will display a reference trace also. 
To Set up a reference trace please follow these instructions:

1. navigate to the control-all-loasis/user data folder.
2. Create a folder with the name of the spectrometer and save the reference trace in this folder. I have already done this for XPW_Spectrometer at "W:\Software\control-all-loasis\user data" as an example. If the folder with the name of teh spectrometer already exists, do not create another one.
3. Open the configurations.ini file, and add the path to the reference trace against the name of the spectrometer. example: XPW_Spectrometer= "W:\\Software\\control-all-loasis\\user data\\XPW_Spectrometer\\XPW_Spectrometer_001.txt"
Look in the configurations.ini file located at "W:\Software\control-all-loasis\user data" to find the path for the XPW_Spectrometer as an example.
