PLasma 1 HP controtroller (300 psia) is an absolute pressure controller. All others are gauge pressure controllers.

All Alicats have to be manually given unique address starting from A to Z

Currently the device on the control system for AlicatPC interacts with 2 controllers at a time. 

The Gauge meter (Device 3) should be enabled if present.

Absolute pressure set is implemented in the GUI and not in the device. (GUIS have to be changed)


PL2-PresCtl device is based on the old AlicatPC device type
It is located on computer 14.67 connected to the COM to USB trip lite (COM14).
Both the controllers on PL2 are now Gauge units as there is no gauge reader connected.
