The LB Power Meter is called LB_PowerMeter and uses the Anywhere USB with IP address 192.168.14.136. Current computer : 192.168.14.67
The native Utility "AnywhereUSB Remote HUB Coonfiguration Utility" has to be started and the connect button has to be clicked for the HUB.
The COM port shows up as COM11 in Device Driver.
This is used by the Device to read the Energy Meter readings

The TEA Power Meter is called BELLA_TEA_PowerMeter and uses the Anywhere USB with IP address 192.168.14.73. Current computer : 192.168.14.81
The native Utility "AnywhereUSB Remote HUB Coonfiguration Utility" has to be started and the connect button has to be clicked for the HUB.

Note: When 17.7 is switched off or rebooted and 14.77 is running/ON. The AnywhereUSB Hub automatically jumps and connects to 14.77. 
The Bella_TEA_Power meter then fails. Solution is to switch off 14.77.
